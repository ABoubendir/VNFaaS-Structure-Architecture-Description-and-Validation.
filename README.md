# VNFaaS-Structure-Architecture-Description-and-Validation.
This repository contains further material related to the VNFaaS paper.

First the opensource codes (MJSIP http://www.mjsip.org/download/index.html and Little IMS https://github.com/ABoubendir/littleims) that have been used to analyze the functionnalities of IMS network functions.

By analyzing these network functions codes, we have realized that identifying the network functions that are involved in the Authentification and Authorization (AAA function) in IMS in order to extract it from them can be the first step.

We have then focused on P-CSCF, S-CSCF and HSS. Authentication and Authorization are tightly coupled in a way that we do not even distinguish two procedures. As explained in http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-3261.txt and http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-4740.html. 

After this analysis, we have extracted all functionnalities related to Authentication and Authorization from these functions to rethink Authentication and Authorization in IMS to be perfomed by dedicated service components modeled as-a-Service based on the propsosed properties (stateless, cohesive, ...) 

Of course CSCF network functions and thus AAA fucntion do not respect as-a-Service properties (they are statefull, tightly coupled,..)

We build our business code for an Authentication function and another one for Authorization function respecting the properties when defining the service logic as explained in the paper. 

Then, we build the architectural design based on "as-a-Service" generic architecture relying on VCE Editor in VerCors platform (on Eclipse) for the architecture defenition and interfaces and behavior specifications. We prepare 2 components: Authentication-as-a-Service and Authorization-as-a-Service as well as composition of these two components representing the Authentication and Authorization sc√©nario as shown in the call flow. 

Then, we perform a verification and validation of the VNFaaS components architecture and structure through VerCors Platform. 

VersCors platform is composed of different modules as shown in figure VerCors_platform_principles.png. The principles of VerCors are explained in the joint file: Architecture Verification and Validation over VerCors Modeling Platform.txt. 

The composition of Authentication-as-a-Service and Authorization-as-a-Service with interfaces is shown in figure Composition1.png. 

The validation of the architecture results is the Architecture Description Language (ADL) file: VNFaaS-composition.adl 

This file is the formal architecture description. 

Then we include our business codes (the service logic) in the Content of each VNFaaS component. 

MJSIP contains a User Agent Client SIP application. 
We use it to access the as-as-Service Authentication and Authorization network functions as shown in the call flow. 

We implement the Authentication-as-a-Service and Authorization-as-a-Service components using ProaActive (https://github.com/scale-proactive/scale-proactive). The figure Implementation Environement.png shows the different platforms used and their roles.
Using Proactive, we implement the VNF components in VMs from Grid5000 virtual infrastructure (https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/Grid5000:Home) which represents the NFVI. It relies on Openstack as a Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM).  
Proactive acts as a Virtual Network Function Manager as it ensures the life-cycle management of the VNF components.
